# Generating figures and statistical results for this project

Follow the [setup instructions](https://github.com/ContextLab/attention-memory-task/blob/master/README.md) before running the project code.

Running the notebooks in this folder will produce all figures and statistical results reported in the [main paper](https://github.com/ContextLab/attention-memory-task/blob/master/paper/main.pdf) and [supplement](https://github.com/ContextLab/attention-memory-task/blob/master/paper/supplemental_materials.pdf), as follows:

- Figure 2: analysis.ipynb
- Figure 3: stimuli.ipynb
- Figure 4: analysis.ipynb
- Figures S1--S5: analysis.ipynb
- Participant demographic information: demographics.ipynb

Most of the statistical results reported in the main text are generated in
analysis.ipynb. Where needed, each notebook will also download any data needed
for the notebook's analyses. Downloaded files will be stored in the data folder
and sub-folders.
